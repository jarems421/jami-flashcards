 * app into a settings panel; a row of pills, which fixed the size and left five
 * unattached bubbles floating over the setup screen; the shared `OptionSwitch`,
 * which put them on the product's grid and still spent five tiles of a study
 * screen on a choice most students make once. It is a dropdown now: the current
 * mode is a pill, and the other four with their explanations are one click
 * behind it.
 *
 * It appears on all three ways to study rather than only on Daily Review, so
 * the choice is where the session starts. The mode is remembered per student,
 * so choosing here chooses everywhere -- what a surface changes is what a
 * rating then does, which is what `SURFACE_NOTE` says out loud.
