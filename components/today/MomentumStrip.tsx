 * Seven days, as dots.

 * The whole of Today's statistics, on purpose. Reviews, accuracy, streaks,
 * time studied and decks completed are all real numbers Jami holds, and a
 * student who opens their home page to a wall of them is being asked to audit
 * themselves before they have done anything.
 *
 * So this says one thing: you have been here. A lit dot is a day with at least
 * one review, and nothing about the dot changes with how many -- forty reviews
 * and one are the same dot, because the point being made is the habit rather
 * than the volume, and a dot that grew would quietly turn a calm strip back
 * into a metric.
