/**
 * Two or three views of one thing, switched between without leaving it.
 *
 * Built from links rather than buttons so every view has its own address: a
 * student can bookmark the one they use, the back button behaves, and another
 * page can send somebody straight to the right view.
 *
 * The point is that the views a student is *not* looking at stay visible. A
 * surface split across separate navigation entries hides half of itself from
 * anyone who has not found the other entry yet.
 *
 * Drawn as a row of underlined labels along the bottom of the page header,
 * rather than as a control of its own. It used to be a bordered pill shell on
 * the `--nav-shell-*` tokens, which put a third piece of chrome below the
 * sidebar and the top bar -- the same frame, the same two-line label-and-detail
 * items, three times over, before any of the student's own work appeared.
 *
 * Deliberately not on `.app-nav`: that class hides itself inside the notebook
 * editor, takes a constellation background override, and is forced to the page
 * shell radius. All three are right for a shell and wrong for a row nested in
 * one.
