                    * handle submission asks for, so on a phone a student who never
                    * opened working could not submit at all. So the sheet keeps its
                    * one mount point and takes on the dialog's obligations instead --
                    * a labelled modal role, focus moved in and restored on close,
                    * Escape, and the rest of the page hidden from assistive
                    * technology while it covers the screen.

                    * None of that applies to a question with its own paper. There the
                    * sheet is the question, it is on the page at every width, and the
                    * way to write on it at full size is the control the sheet already
                    * carries.
