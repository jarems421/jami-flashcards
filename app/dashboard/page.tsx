/**
 * The Study Hub.
 *
 * Today answers one question -- what should I do now? -- and it is laid out
 * like a page of a planner so the answer is the first thing on it. The day's
 * plan, contained, with the next task marked; what Jami suggests beyond it;
 * what can be done any time. Without a plan, Jami's suggestions lead in the
 * same place, so it is one page either way.
 *
 * What it deliberately is not is a dashboard. Every count Jami holds could go
 * on this page and the result would be a student auditing themselves before
 * they had studied anything. The rule that keeps it honest: show the smallest
 * amount of information that makes the next decision easy, and put the rest
 * somewhere it can be asked for.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what to study. The Learning Engine chooses, the
 * intervention catalogue chooses what can be done about it, and the planner
 * says how much time there is. This page composes those three answers and
 * never adds a fourth.
