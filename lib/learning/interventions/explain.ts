/**
 * The engine's decision, said to the student.
 *
 * Every sentence here is looked up from the decision, never written by a model
 * and never assembled from a score. That is the whole design: a student asking
 * "why this?" is asking Jami to account for itself, and an answer that varied
 * between two identical situations would not be an account of anything.
 *
 * Two rules hold it together.
 *
 * **Nothing internal escapes.** `recall_strong_application_weak` is how the
 * catalogue names a situation; "Your recall is strong, but application is
 * weaker" is that situation in the student's own words. No reason code, action
 * type, intervention id, mastery value, confidence or evidence weight appears
 * in anything this module returns.
 *
 * **Nothing is claimed that was not counted.** The evidence line says how many
 * answers there are and where they came from, and when there are none it says
 * that instead. It would be easy, and wrong, to let an unevidenced concept
 * borrow the phrasing of a weak one: the engine reaches those two states by
 * opposite routes, and a student told "this has been going badly" about
 * something they have never answered has been misled about themselves.
