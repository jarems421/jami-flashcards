/**
 * A verdict Tutor reached on a page of a student's own working.
 *
 * Tutor has always been able to mark notebook working; it answered in prose
 * and nothing was kept, so the most considered work a student does produced no
 * evidence at all. This is the record that changes that -- and it is the one
 * piece of learner evidence not marked against a published scheme, so it is
 * held to a stricter standard on the way in rather than a looser one.
 *
 * **Fail closed.** A verdict that is not a complete, internally coherent,
 * machine-readable marking is discarded. "Looks mostly right, probably 4 out
 * of 5" is a helpful thing to say to a student and is not evidence. There is
 * no partial credit for a partial record: notebook evidence already carries a
 * low source weight, and compensating for weak structure by accepting vague
 * output would be the exact wrong direction -- it would let the least reliable
 * source be the most permissive one.
 *
 * **What is deliberately not stored.** Criterion wording is kept, because it
 * is the marker's own language and the error-category rules read it. The
 * student's own answer text is not, anywhere: past-paper markings carry a
 * `candidateValue` per criterion and this does not, because that field is the
 * student's writing and a notebook page is where a student writes most freely.
 * Nothing here holds what they wrote -- only whether each point was earned.
