 * "First night": the sign-up walkthrough.
 *
 * A short welcome on a night sky that turns the student's subjects into
 * folders, a tour of the real sidebar, then a first constellation on Today.
 * Each star is something the student actually does -- writes in a notebook,
 * makes a flashcard and reviews it, asks Jami, answers a real exam question,
 * sets a goal -- and it lights when the app hears it happen, not when a note
 * is dismissed. Finishing earns the account's real first star, and the
 * walkthrough ends by taking the student to see it in their sky.
 *
 * Progress is kept on the account and mirrored on the device.
 * `?first-night=preview` starts it afresh and `?first-night=off` ends it, for
 * anyone checking it by hand.
