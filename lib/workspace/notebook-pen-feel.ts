 *   on the input, and the light easing of the curve drawn through it.
 * - Corner sharpness is whether a turn is drawn as a point or carried through
 *   as a curve.
 *
 * They used to be one slider, which moved both at once. That is why turning
 * Smoothing down to keep a line faithful also turned every curve in it into a
 * run of corners, and why nothing could round the corners off without also
 * dragging the line away from the pen. There is no single right answer to
 * either -- a fast joined-up hand wants its turns carried through, and a
 * careful printed one wants every deliberate point kept -- so each is a
 * setting rather than a constant.
