/**
 * The tip of the line, drawn a moment ahead of the pen.
 *
 * Between the glass and a lit pixel sit the digitiser, the browser handing the
 * event over, the frame the canvas waits for and the frame the screen waits
 * for. In Safari on an iPad that adds up to a few frames, and it is most of
 * what makes ink feel as if it trails the Pencil. None of it is Jami's to
 * remove: `notebook-ink-latency.ts` measures the part that is, and the
 * smoothing filter's share of it is under a pixel.
 *
 * What native note apps do about the rest is draw the next few milliseconds of
 * the line before they arrive, from the system's own prediction of where the
 * pen is going, and replace them with the real samples a frame later. Web
 * pages get the same prediction from `PointerEvent.getPredictedEvents()`:
 * Chrome has had it for years, and Safari since 18.2 (iPadOS 18.2), which is
 * what makes it worth doing here.
 *
 * Two earlier attempts at closing this gap were removed, and this is shaped by
 * what sank each:
 *
 *  - Lag correction (`notebook-ink-prediction.ts`) wrote its lead into the
 *    stroke, so wherever the pen slowed or wobbled the line stepped back along
 *    itself. This tip is never part of the stroke. It is painted on the live
 *    layer after the stroke, wiped with it every frame, and never reaches
 *    js-draw's geometry, the saved page or undo.
 *  - The Web Ink API trail was drawn by the compositor, outside anything the
 *    app renders, and could linger a frame or two past the lift. This tip
 *    goes in the same task that commits the stroke, and is withheld as soon as
 *    pressure falls away at the lift.
 *
 * A prediction is still a guess, and a guess goes wrong at a turn or when the
 * browser is fed uneven timestamps -- Chrome was seen predicting hundreds of
 * pixels ahead, and backwards, from a burst of samples. So it is used only
 * inside an envelope built from what the pen has really just done: no further
 * ahead than `maxAheadMs`, no faster than a little over the pen's own recent
 * speed, never off to the side of or back against the way it is moving, never
 * longer than `maxLengthPx`, and less and then not at all while the pen is
 * turning. Handwriting is mostly turns, so in a word the tip mostly stands
 * down; it does its work on the straighter strokes, where it can be trusted.
