/**
 * Recognising a scribble-out.
 *
 * Scribbling over a word to delete it is a gesture people already know, but it
 * is destructive and it lives on the pen -- the tool used for everything else.
 * A false positive deletes work nobody asked to delete, so the question is not
 * "could this be a scribble?" but "could this be anything else?".
 *
 * Several signals have to agree. Individually each has a plausible innocent
 * explanation: `w` and `m` reverse direction, shading retraces a band, a fast
 * flick covers ground quickly. Together they describe a motion that handwriting
 * mostly does not make.
 *
 * Mostly, not entirely -- and that boundary is where this used to go wrong. The
 * shape of a small scribble and the shape of a small `w` are genuinely close,
 * and every rule added to separate them broke something people actually do:
 * requiring a thin band stopped whole words, blocks of lines and scribbles-over-
 * scribbles from registering, and requiring a word's worth of length stopped
 * single letters. The gates here are therefore deliberately permissive about
 * shape and size.
 *
 * The safety is that recognising a scribble deletes nothing on its own. Ink has
 * to be *decisively covered* by it -- see `NOTEBOOK_SCRIBBLE_MIN_COVERAGE` and
 * `planNotebookScribbleErase`. A `w` written on blank paper covers nothing and
 * is simply drawn, whatever this function thinks of it. What is left is writing
 * a letter directly on top of existing work, which is not a thing people do by
 * accident, and which one press of undo reverses.
 *
 * Samples arrive in **screen pixels**, in whatever frame the caller is using.
 * Every measurement here is translation-invariant, so the origin does not
 * matter -- which is what lets the editor collect raw pointer coordinates
 * during a stroke and work out where the page is only once a scribble has
 * actually been found. Locating the page costs a layout flush, and doing that
 * at the start of every stroke was enough to make writing feel like it dragged.
 *
 * The thresholds split by what they measure. Size belongs to the content --
 * "about as wide as a word" means a word on the page, whatever the zoom -- so
 * its threshold is scaled by `viewportScale` to meet the samples where they
 * are. Speed and tremor belong to the hand, which does not know what the zoom
 * is, and are compared directly. Measuring everything one way or the other
 * makes the gesture trivial to trigger at one end of the zoom range and
 * impossible at the other. The page is 900 units across.
