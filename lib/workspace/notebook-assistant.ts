 * The three ways into a fresh notebook chat.
 *
 * Three, always: a wall of chips over an empty conversation reads as a menu to
 * study rather than a nudge to start. Once the page has work on it, checking
 * that work is the most useful thing Jami can do, so it takes the quiz's place.
 * Past Paper Practice and Revision Sessions used to sit here too; they open
 * somewhere else entirely rather than start a chat, and the folder page offers
 * both.
