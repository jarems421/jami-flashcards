/**
 * A pen that draws the line the hand actually made.
 *
 * js-draw fits a stroke by growing one quadratic at a time and cutting it as
 * soon as a sample falls outside tolerance -- and every new piece starts with
 * a control arm only half a pen width long, so it leaves the join almost
 * straight. On a long curve that reads as a chain of flat chords.
 *
 * Measured on a noisy half-arc, no amount of input smoothing fixes it: from
 * beta 0.3 down to 0.015 (a lag of half a pixel out to ten) the fitter still
 * carved the same curve into 13 pieces down to 8, and the deviation stayed
 * pinned at its 3-pixel ceiling the whole way. The chords are the fitter, not
 * the input.
 *
 * So there is no fitting here. The samples are joined by a Catmull-Rom spline
 * written out as cubic Béziers, which passes through every point and is
 * C1-continuous by construction: consecutive pieces share a tangent, so no
 * join can show. What is drawn is what was sampled, smoothed on the way in.
