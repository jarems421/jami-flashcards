 * reading it: pick the long one. It is answerable the other way too -- a

 * shape -- "same length, same opening" -- because a twenty-nine word answer sat
 * under three ten-word wrong ones is answerable by looking at it. That rewrite
 * is the point, and it is also the risk: a condensation that quietly adds or
 * changes a claim would mark a student against something their card never said.
 *
 * So the test is containment rather than equivalence. Every content word of the
 * short option has to appear in the card's answer, which allows a faithful
 * condensation and refuses anything that brings in a new idea. It cannot catch
 * a condensation that *narrows* the answer -- only reading it can -- and the
 * prompt forbids that separately.
 *
 * Deliberately lives here, beside the other shape rules, because the validator
 * that stores a variant and the builder that shows it have to apply exactly the
 * same test. They did not: the validator accepted shortened correct options and
 * the builder then rejected them and fell back to the card's raw answer, which
 * failed the length band every time. Cards were stored with variants that could
 * never be built, and a Multiple Choice session dropped most of its queue.
