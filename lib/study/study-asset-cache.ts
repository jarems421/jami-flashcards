/**
 * Whether a stored document already answers for this card, so preparing it
 * again would buy nothing.
 *
 * A success under the current content does, and so does a card the model
 * turned down -- asking again would pay for the same refusal. A failure that
 * was not a refusal does not: a timeout, a provider error or a reply that could
 * not be read says nothing about the card. Those used to be stored exactly like
 * refusals, and a card that met one blip then could not be asked as multiple
 * choice until its text was edited. Records from before the distinction carry
 * no kind, and are asked again for the same reason.
 *
 * A session pinned to multiple choice also asks once more about a card that
 * was prepared with no question: the review may simply have turned down both
 * of the first attempt's variants. Once per prompt version, so a card that
 * genuinely suits no multiple choice costs one second try and no more.
