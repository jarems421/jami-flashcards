/**
 * How a Tutor answer is thought about: quickly, with more thought, or deeply.
 *
 * Measured on Tutor-sized questions (October 2026), the fast model answered in
 * one to five seconds and the thinking model in fifteen to a hundred, a third of
 * the time breaking before it finished. On hard competition problems the fast
 * model was right nine times in ten at low effort and at high alike. So more
 * thought is cheap on the fast model, and the thinking role is kept for what
 * earns its place: a disputed answer, an idea that keeps coming back, a request
 * too long or too widely sourced to take in quickly.
 *
 * - quick: the fast model, little thought. Definitions, recall, hints.
 * - think: the fast model, thinking hard. Problems, proofs, marking, "why".
 * - deep: the thinking role, its fastest model first (Kimi K3, then Qwen).
