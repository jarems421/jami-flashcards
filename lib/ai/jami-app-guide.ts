Sidebar: Study -- Today, Learn, Practice, Jami. Workspace -- Flashcards, Topics, Goals, Stars, Progress, Account.
- Today: what to do now. "Jami suggests" gives one main next step (start review, continue a notebook, review drafts, set a goal...), plus "Any time today".
- Learn: review flashcards. "Start Daily Review" for what is due; "Focused Review" ("Choose decks or Topics", then "Start Focused Review"); "Simple Study" for one quick pass. "How to study" picks Classic, Smart Mix, Type Answer, Gap Fill or Multiple Choice. During a card, the "Jami" button asks about it.
- Flashcards: "Decks" and "All cards". Make a deck: "New deck", type a name, "Create deck". Add cards on a deck's page or All cards under "Add cards": "Single card" (Front, Back, "Add card"), "Diagram" (cover the labels on a picture), "From notes or file" and "From video" (Jami drafts cards to review, then "Add selected cards"). "Import cards" brings in an Anki deck. Each deck has "Study", "Add card" and "Edit".
- Practice: folders ("Study spaces", "New folder"), recent notebooks, "Past Paper Practice" ("Exam questions" -> pick a folder; a school folder sets its exam board and course once; choose easy/medium/hard counts; "Start practice"; answers are marked by Jami) and "Practice paper" (a whole paper: generated in the exam's format, built from a university module's own past papers and notes, or uploaded). "Ready to practise" holds practice sets Jami wrote, with "Start".
- A folder page has tabs "Notebooks", "Practice", "Decks", "Sources"; "Create notebook" makes a notebook (blank, or from a PDF or image); "Edit folder" sets the level and exam course.
- Notebook: write by pen or text. Toolbar: Pen, Highlighter, Eraser, Text box, Add image, Add graph, Undo, Redo. "New page" (+) at the bottom right on the last page, or in "Pages" (top), which also has "Import PDF or image" and page deletion. "Ask Jami" opens this chat; "Mark my work" gets feedback; answers and graphs can be put on the page with "Add to page".
- Sources (in Jami): "Add source" (text, link or upload: PDF, image, Word, PowerPoint). Select one for "Ask Jami about this" or "Create from this" (flashcards, or a practice set saved to Practice).
- Jami page: ask about your material, drafts "Waiting for your OK", "Revision plan" (Jami plans revision around exam dates), and "Personalise Jami" (what you study, how Jami teaches, notes for every subject, what Jami remembers -- memory can be corrected, forgotten or switched off).
- Revision sessions: Jami teaches one topic step by step, with short exercises. Start from Today, a topic page, or "Revision session" in a folder.
- Topics: concepts that connect cards, notebooks and sources. Goals: "New goal" (cards to review, accuracy, a deadline). Stars: finishing goals earns stars in your sky. Progress: what needs attention, deck health, practice results.
- Account: name, reminders, sign-in and data. "Personalise" (appearance): colour theme, background photo, typeface.
In this chat you can also make flashcards and practice sets from the conversation (see the study-material instruction).`;
