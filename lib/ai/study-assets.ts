Return ONLY a JSON object. No prose, no markdown fence.

For each card you are given, produce one entry:
{
  "cardId": string,
  "answerShape": "numeric" | "list" | "short" | "prose",
  "acceptedAliases": string[],
  "requiredConcepts": string[],
  "confidence": number between 0 and 1,
  "ambiguous": boolean,
  "task": "term" | "definition" | "quantity" | "calculation" | "list" | "process" | "comparison" | "explanation" | "formula" | "quotation" | "extended" | "ambiguous",
  "preferredModes": ("classic" | "type-answer" | "gap-fill" | "multiple-choice")[],
  "suitableModes": ("classic" | "type-answer" | "gap-fill" | "multiple-choice")[],
  "gapVariants": [{ "id": string, "gaps": [{ "answer": string, "acceptedAnswers": string[], "concept": string }] }],
  "mcqVariants": [{ "id": string, "correctAnswer": string, "distractors": string[], "explanations": { "<option text>": "<why it is right or wrong>" } }]
}

Rules you must not break:
- NEVER rewrite, correct, improve or replace the card's answer. You are adding to it, not editing it.
- acceptedAliases are other ways to write THE SAME answer. Not related answers. Not broader answers.
- requiredConcepts are the ideas a correct answer must contain, each a short noun phrase.
- Set ambiguous true and confidence low when the card is unclear, has more than one defensible answer, or you are guessing.
- An honest low confidence is worth more than a confident invention.
- Read the question and answer together. Pick only formats that genuinely suit the learning task. Classic is a normal preferred mode, especially for explanations, definitions, formulae and ambiguous material.
- Produce one or two substantively different variants for each suitable interactive format. One sound variant is better than two weak ones.
- Keep every explanation to one short sentence. Write nothing the student will not see.

gapVariants -- the words worth hiding:
- Each gap answer must be an exact substring of the card's answer, copied character for character.
- Choose the word that carries the meaning: the term being defined, the quantity, the mechanism, the one word a student who half-knew this would get wrong.
- Never choose a word the question already contains, and never a word whose absence leaves a sentence anyone could complete from grammar alone.
- Prefer one word or a short phrase. Hiding half the answer is not a gap, it is the whole question again.
- A variant may contain one to three non-overlapping gaps. Across a variant, hide no more than one third of the answer. Different variants must test different concepts or combinations, not cosmetic wording.

mcqVariants -- multiple choice, and the part that matters most. Each variant has exactly three wrong options in "distractors":
- Each wrong option must be a plausible answer TO THIS QUESTION and definitely wrong. Not a fact about something else, not an answer to a neighbouring topic.
- Write the mistakes a student actually makes: the neighbouring concept people confuse this with, the right idea at the wrong scale or stage, the common misremembering, the plausible-sounding invention.
- A student who has not learned this should have no way to tell which is right by looking at the options alone. If one option is obviously the only real answer, you have failed.
- Never a second correct answer, never a synonym, never a broader or narrower version of the true answer.
- MATCH THE ANSWER'S SHAPE, and treat this as a hard requirement rather than a preference. Count the words in the correct option. Every wrong option must be within roughly half to twice that count, carry the same grammatical form, the same register, the same capitalisation, and the same final punctuation.
  - If the answer is a full sentence ending in a full stop, every wrong option is a full sentence ending in a full stop.
  - If the answer is one word or a short phrase, every wrong option is one word or a short phrase.
  - If the answer names a thing, every wrong option names a thing of the same kind. Do not answer "which organelle" with three organelles and one process.
  Length is the tell students use to skip the question: a set where the true answer is the long, complete, specific one is guessable by somebody who cannot read the subject, and it is worse than no question at all.
- Be specific in the wrong options too. One that is vague, hedged, or obviously a non-answer ("none of these", "it varies", "a type of cell") gives the game away as surely as a short one.
- NEVER let one option restate the question and the others not. If the card's answer opens by repeating the question back ("When a plant cell is placed in pure water, water moves in...") then either every wrong option opens with that same clause, or none does and you write the correct option without it ("Water moves in..."). An option that names the question it is answering is the one a student picks without reading the others.
- All four options must be interchangeable on sight: same opening word class, same tense, same length to within a few words, same level of detail. Read your four options with the answer hidden. If you can still tell which is right, rewrite them.
- Make the wrong options genuinely tempting. The best one is the option a student who half-learned this would defend: the right mechanism with the wrong direction, the right process under the wrong name, the correct effect for the opposite condition.
- explanations has one entry for each of the four options, keyed by that option's exact text: for a wrong option, what a student choosing it was probably thinking of, teaching the difference rather than scolding; for the correct option, why it is right.
- Variants must use substantively different wrong options; shuffling does not make a new variant.
- correctAnswer is where you match the shape. Write the card's answer the way the three wrong options are written -- same length, same opening, no restatement of the question -- while saying exactly and only what the card's answer says. Never narrow it, broaden it or add a claim the card does not make.
- When the card's answer is maths, correctAnswer is the card's answer copied exactly, and every wrong option is maths in the same notation and form, inside $...$ like the answer. Do not change the form: a fraction stays a fraction rather than a decimal, and a factorised expression keeps its order. The best wrong options are the slips a student makes: a sign error, a missing factor, the wrong power, the inverse relationship.
- If you cannot write three genuinely wrong-but-tempting options for this card, return an empty mcqVariants array. That costs the student nothing. A guessable question costs them a wrong idea about what they know.
- Every mcqVariant is checked after you return it: any variant whose wrong options are not within roughly half to twice the correct option's word count, or where only one option restates the question, is discarded. A variant you take care over is worth two you do not.
