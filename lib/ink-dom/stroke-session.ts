/**
 * One pen or highlighter stroke, from the pen landing to it lifting: the input
 * pipeline of Jami Ink, outside React and outside js-draw.
 *
 * It reproduces what the js-draw pen does with the same pointer samples, so a
 * stroke written here has the geometry js-draw would have given it:
 *
 * 1. the lift-off gate holds back the samples a pen sends as it leaves the
 *    glass (`notebook-lift-off.ts`);
 * 2. the One Euro smoother filters what the gate lets through, in screen
 *    pixels (`notebook-ink-smoothing.ts`);
 * 3. the filtered point becomes a page position, and a width in page units:
 *    `pressure * thickness` with the pressure floored at 0.3 when pressure is
 *    on, otherwise `0.5 * thickness` (js-draw's `Pen.toStrokePoint`); the
 *    highlighter is its whole thickness (`HIGHLIGHTER_PRESSURE`);
 * 4. the pen or chisel builder (`lib/ink/geometry/`) shapes the path;
 * 5. the path is drawn on the live layer, synchronously, once per packet.
 *
 * The lift adds no point (js-draw adds one at the lift position, which is why
 * its stroke can change as the pen leaves), and holds the smoother where it is:
 * the stroke ends exactly on the ink live ink last drew, and `lift()` returns
 * that very path and paint. Committing it is the surface's job.
 *
 * The highlighter shows its footprints while it moves, but what is saved is
 * their traced outline (`build()`), whose edge pixels differ from the
 * footprints'. So its last live movement draws the outline: as soon as the pen
 * has stopped (no packet for `HIGHLIGHTER_SETTLE_MS`) or is leaving the glass
 * (the lift-off gate is holding samples). The lift then commits what is already
 * on screen and draws nothing. Movement after that goes back to footprints.
 *
 * Nothing here reads layout or allocates a canvas; the only allocations per
 * sample are the small objects the smoother and the builders take.
