/**
 * Live ink: the stroke being written, drawn synchronously on every packet.
 *
 * It is drawn into live tiles: canvases from the same pool as the dry tiles
 * (the same size), placed on the same grid at the same positions, and drawn
 * through the same rasteriser with the same transform. Chrome antialiases
 * differently on canvases of different sizes, and the same path under two
 * translations can land a float rounding apart; one grid rules out both.
 *
 * A live tile also stands in for the dry tile beneath it. The first time a
 * stroke reaches a tile, the dry tile of the stroke's layer is copied into the
 * live tile (one full-tile copy per tile per stroke) and hidden, so what the
 * screen shows there is a composite the canvas made, not one the compositor
 * blends from two layers: the two round a translucent blend differently (by
 * one level in 255 where a stroke crosses ink of its own layer), and the lift
 * must not change a pixel. At the lift the live tile simply becomes the dry
 * tile (`InkTileStore.adopt`), so nothing is drawn or copied.
 *
 * Each packet paints the whole stroke again in every tile where it changed
 * since the last packet (`inkPathChange`): there the dry pixels are put back
 * and the stroke painted over them. A tile the change does not reach already
 * shows exactly this stroke, since a pixel depends only on the geometry
 * crossing it, so it is left alone.
 *
 * The predicted tip rides on the same repaint: a short round-capped path drawn
 * after the stroke in each tile that is repainted. Where the tip was and where
 * it now is count as changed, like the stroke's own change, so a tile it left
 * or reached is repainted; the lift first repaints those tiles with the stroke
 * alone, so the tip never reaches the dry tiles.
 *
 * Canvases are lent by the tile store when a stroke first reaches a tile on
 * screen and given back when it ends. The store keeps a screenful of spares
 * warm; with none spare it takes one from a tile out of sight, and it never
 * makes one during a stroke. With nothing to lend, the tile is noted as
 * missed: the stroke does not show there while it is written, and the lift
 * paints it in. Nothing is reserved for live ink.
 *
 * Live tiles stack in tile order (`compareInkTiles`), the order the lift
 * adopts them in, so the lift does not change their stacking. Canvases that
 * abut meet in a seam row where each covers a hair of the other, and which one
 * sits on top shifts the stroke's edge pixels there by a level in 255. A
 * stroke that crossed a tile seam showed it: its live tiles stacked in the
 * order the stroke reached them, and adopting them in tile order changed those
 * pixels at the lift.
 *
 * One layer serves both kinds of stroke. Its stacking puts it between the dry
 * highlighter and dry pen layers for a highlighter stroke, so the highlighter
 * is under pen ink while it is written too, and above everything for a pen
 * stroke.
