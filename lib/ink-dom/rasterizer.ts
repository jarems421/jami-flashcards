/**
 * The one routine that turns ink into pixels. Dry tiles and live ink both
 * draw through it, with the same path (built once, in page units) and the
 * same transform (device pixels per page unit, and a whole-pixel origin), so
 * the pixels a stroke has while it is written are the pixels it keeps once it
 * is lifted.
 *
 * It mirrors how js-draw's `CanvasRenderer` painted a path, because js-draw is
 * what students have been looking at:
 *
 * - fill first (when there is one), then stroke;
 * - strokes always round-capped and round-joined at the item's width;
 * - a closing `Z` is drawn as a line back to the subpath's start, as js-draw's
 *   own path type does;
 * - one path per item, so a translucent highlighter whose subpaths overlap is
 *   filled once and never darkens where they cross.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences, both in `docs/notebook-ink.md`: highlighter ink
 * is drawn under pen ink (the caller orders layers), and an item's `opacity`
 * (from old v1 pages) is honoured.
