/**
 * Making a revision plan with Jami, as a fixed sequence of questions.
 *
 * It used to be an open conversation: the student said something, and the
 * model decided whether that was enough to propose a whole plan. It usually
 * decided yes after one message, so plans arrived all at once, built on
 * guesses, and came out generic. Nothing asked about exams before choosing
 * subjects, or about the week before filling it, and nothing asked "anything
 * else?" before the plan started.
 *
 * So the structure lives here, not in a prompt. Four questions in the order
 * anyone would plan -- what you're working towards, which subjects, when you
 * can study, anything else -- then a last check before it starts. Every step
 * can be answered by tapping, which needs no model at all, or in the student's
 * own words, which the model reads. Either way, a step may only change the
 * parts of the plan it asks about, so the plan fills in one piece at a time
 * and an answer about Tuesdays cannot quietly rewrite the exams.
 *
 * The model never decides which question comes next or when the plan is done.
