# AI operations runbook

Jami exposes capabilities, not provider or model controls. Browser payloads,
Firestore student documents, analytics, and student-facing errors must never
contain provider names, model IDs, route decisions, prompts, responses, source
text, student work, image bytes, or cost metadata.

## Release sequence

1. Deploy Firestore indexes/rules and Storage rules before enabling any new AI
   surface.
2. Configure the server-only variables in `.env.example` for Preview. Keep
   every API key and Firebase Admin credential sensitive.
3. Complete the privacy and quality gates in
   `docs/ai-provider-release-gates.md`.
4. Run `npm run check:ai-release` inside the Preview deployment environment.
   This live check must pass for every OpenRouter role.
5. Exercise all kill switches using synthetic content, then restore only the
   capabilities approved for release.
6. Run the offline quality benchmark, automated verification, browser checks,
   and a paper-workflow restart/cancellation drill.
7. Cut over production atomically. Do not shadow or replay real student
   content.

## Kill switches

| Incident scope | Immediate action |
|---|---|
| All OpenRouter text inference | Set `OPENROUTER_KILL_SWITCH=true` |
| Independent juror only | Set `OPENROUTER_JUROR_KILL_SWITCH=true` |
| All Gemini specialist inference | Set `GEMINI_KILL_SWITCH=true` |

Formal paper marking is separately released with
`PRACTICE_PAPER_MARKING_WORKFLOW_ENABLED=true`. Keep it false until Preview has
completed a synthetic submitted paper, overtime dual scoring, cancellation,
retry, question recheck, and deletion. The service-wide marking lease defaults
to four jobs (`PRACTICE_PAPER_MARKING_JOB_CONCURRENCY=4`) and the automatic
provider ceiling defaults to `$0.50`
(`PRACTICE_PAPER_MARKING_MAX_COST_USD=0.50`). A job that reaches the ceiling
pauses with its evidence and completed provider checkpoints intact; raising the
ceiling or retrying after an operational review does not consume another daily
allowance.
| Grounded web/URL research | Set `AI_WEB_RESEARCH_ENABLED=false` |
| Tutor illustrations | Set `AI_TUTOR_IMAGES_ENABLED=false` |
| Paper raster illustrations | Set `AI_PAPER_IMAGES_ENABLED=false` |
| Exam-format library | Set `EXAM_FORMAT_LIBRARY_ENABLED=false` |
| Low-confidence format confirmation | Set `PAPER_FORMAT_CONFIRMATION_ENABLED=false` |
| Owner paper-generation benchmark | Set `PAPER_GENERATION_BENCHMARK_ENABLED=false` |

After changing a kill switch, redeploy or refresh the runtime environment,
verify that the affected endpoint fails safely, and record the incident. A
disabled specialist must not silently fall back to a general text model.

## Content-free telemetry

Aggregate only these fields from `ai.provider` events:

- logical role and stable route reason;
- approved provider endpoint and configured model ID (operations access only);
- latency, input/output/total token counts, and estimated cost;
- success/failure category and numeric upstream status;
- workflow stage, duration, retry count, cancellation count, and queue depth.

Do not attach a user ID, email, folder/notebook/source/paper ID, free-form error
message, request URL, prompt, answer, citation, source title, file name, or any
student content. Dashboards should show p50/p95 latency, error rate, escalation
rate, queue age, jobs per stage, token/cost totals, and quota rejection counts.

Alert on:

- privacy/release-check failure (page immediately; keep the gate closed);
- spend threshold or abnormal token growth;
- sustained provider failure or empty/invalid structured responses;
- stuck paper stages, expired leases, repeated retries, or growing queue age;
- image validation failures, marking disagreement spikes, or score-bound errors.

## Workflow recovery

Practice-paper steps are idempotent and persist checkpoints. A retry must reuse
the same job and paper IDs, completed artifacts, allowance grant, and assets.
Operators must never create a replacement job merely to resume a clarification.

- A cancellation request takes effect between stages. Remove unfinished paper
  assets and workflow artifacts; only refund an allowance when provider work has
  not started.
- Expired global concurrency leases are safe to reclaim. Never manually edit a
  live lease without first checking its job and workflow run.
- A deployment-interruption drill passes only when the same job resumes without
  duplicate papers, assets, hidden mark schemes, or allowance charges.
- Student-facing failures stay generic. Investigate using content-free failure
  category, workflow stage, timing, and run ID in restricted Vercel tooling.

## Past Paper Practice marking and mark checks

Both AI steps a student can trigger are durable jobs, not parts of the request
that asks for them, and both are bounded by `EXAM_AI_JOB_DEADLINE_MS` and
declared stranded by `EXAM_OPERATION_LEASE_MS`.

### Marking an answer

Marking one exam question is a durable job, not part of the submit request. The
request validates the answer, freezes it, takes the daily allowance and
returns; `markExamQuestionWorkflow` does the marking and writes the result back
to the attempt. The page already polls a `marking` attempt, so the student sees
"being marked now" and the mark arrives when it arrives.

It moved because the request could not hold it. Marking is up to three
sequential provider calls, and `markerTimeoutMs` sizes a single supervisor
report at 408 seconds from measured p99 output and p5 generation rate; the
route had 55 seconds for all three and gave the primary 30. The stage that
overran was reliably the adjudicator -- bought only when two markers disagree
-- so both paid reports were discarded on exactly the answers that most needed
them.

- The job's deadline is `EXAM_AI_JOB_DEADLINE_MS` (10 minutes), a chosen bound
  rather than a measured one. It is not a target: observed markings ran 9.6 to
  28.6 seconds.
- Each marker report is checkpointed on the attempt as it arrives, so a resumed
  job does not buy a report it already has. Their costs still count against the
  marking's audit and ceiling.
- Every write a job makes is conditional on `marking.token`. A resubmission
  issues a new token, and the superseded job can no longer write a mark, a
  failure, or a checkpoint.
- An attempt reading `marking` past `EXAM_OPERATION_LEASE_MS` is stranded, not
  slow. The page offers to mark it again; the evidence is unchanged.
- Failures are recorded on the attempt as a code and a sentence, because the
  request that submitted the answer is long gone. `input_too_large` reopens the
  answer as a draft; `question_changed` and `marking_failed` leave it frozen.

### Checking a mark

A student may ask for one independent check per answer, and
`reviewExamQuestionWorkflow` runs it the same way. It moved for the same reason
and a worse ratio: a check is a juror read and then, when it disagrees, a
supervisor reconciliation -- reports sized at 515 and 408 seconds -- and the
route gave both of them 55 between them.

- The job's identity is `review.token`, a server-generated value, **not**
  `reviewKey`. The key is the client's idempotency token and is derived from the
  session and question, so it is the same string for every check of a given
  answer; a stranded job whose student asked again would still match it.
- The juror report is checkpointed, so a resumed check does not buy the
  expensive half twice.
- **A check that produced nothing is not spent.** `reviewUsed` stays false, the
  mark and feedback are untouched, and the daily allowance is refunded. Every
  route path that does not start a job refunds it too.
- Failures land on the attempt as `reviewFailure`, in the mark check's own
  words: the student's mark stands and their check is still available, which is
  not what the marking sentences say.
- A finished session does **not** cancel a check, unlike a marking. The mark
  report stays reachable from history, and a student may ask there.

## Spend controls

Application quotas are the primary control: 40 Tutor replies per day, six
generated papers per day, eight full-paper markings per day, ten Tutor
illustrations per day, and eight raster visuals per generated paper. Also set
OpenRouter/Google hard or soft budgets and Vercel spend alerts. Keep paper-job
concurrency configurable and start at four globally active jobs.

Re-run privacy approval, the live provider check, and the quality benchmark
after any model, provider allowlist, prompt, routing threshold, privacy term,
retention policy, SDK, or material price change.
