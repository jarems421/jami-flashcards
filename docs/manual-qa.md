# Jami manual QA checklist

What a person has to check by hand before a release, because automated tests
cannot judge it: anything needing an Apple Pencil, anything where the failure is
"looks wrong" rather than "throws", and anything only visible in production.

**Already covered automatically, so do not redo by hand:** `npm run test:e2e`
drives signed-in Chromium against the Firebase emulators through notebook
autosave, drawing and reload; the study review loop and offline replay; browse
and navigation; the Learning Engine's evidence and Today's recommendation; Past
Paper Practice; the First night walkthrough; revision plans; Tutor sources; and
the security headers, at desktop, tablet and phone widths (specs in `e2e/`).
`npm run test:rules` covers the Firestore and Storage rules.

Check layouts at three widths: **desktop ~1440px**, **tablet ~820px**,
**phone ~390px**. Keep the browser console open throughout and note any errors
with the page you were on.

One failure to watch for everywhere: **an equation that makes the whole page
scroll sideways.** Long equations must scroll inside their own box.

## 1. Sign-in and loading

1. Sign in with Google, and with email. A signed-out visit to `/dashboard`
   redirects to sign-in.
2. Hard-reload Today, Learn, Practice, a notebook and Progress. Each loads
   without a console error or a Firebase permission error.
3. Install the app (PWA), open it from the home screen while signed in, and
   confirm it reaches Today.
4. On an account with thousands of cards, open Cards, Progress, Topics and
   Learn twice. The second visit draws at once from the device copy and
   redraws when the server's set arrives. Edit a card, then reload: the edit
   is never shown undone. On Learn's second visit, tap Start Daily Review at
   once: the session opens on the server's cards as soon as they land.

## 2. Notebooks — highest data-loss risk

1. Open an existing notebook with ink on several pages. Every page shows its
   ink, including pages last saved months ago.
2. Draw, type in a text box, and leave the page immediately. Come back: the
   work is there.
3. Flip quickly through ten pages while drawing on some. Nothing lands on the
   wrong page and no page comes back blank.
4. Open a notebook made from a PDF. Pages render and ink sits on top; the
   uploaded PDF itself is never modified.
5. Use the toolbar: Pen (P), Highlighter (H), Eraser (E), Text box (T), Undo and
   Redo, pen and highlighter colour and thickness, and pen smoothing. Undo steps
   back whichever of ink or text happened last.
6. Turn on Scribble to erase in the tool settings and scribble over a word. Only
   what was scribbled over disappears. Then draw a quick circle round a word,
   with the pen and with the highlighter: the circle stays, the word is not
   erased, and the highlighter leaves the middle of the circle clear.
7. On a phone, a notebook shows "Notebook editing works best on iPad or
   desktop." with "Continue anyway"; typed notes still work.

### On an iPad, with a Pencil

8. Write a full page by hand at natural speed. No lag, no dropped strokes, no
   palm marks while your hand rests on the page.
9. Swipe pages with a finger while the Pen is active: fingers turn pages and
   never draw; the Pencil draws and never turns pages.
10. Highlight across a line, then erase part of the highlight. The rest keeps
    its shape, with no bridges or holes.
11. Rotate the device mid-page. The page and the work survive.

## 3. Learn and flashcards

1. Daily Review, Focused Review and Simple Study each start, grade, and finish
   with the right counts.
2. Turn the network off, review three cards, turn it back on. The reviews sync
   once each, and the offline banner comes and goes.
3. Diagram cards: add a picture, cover its labels, and study it both as one
   card and as a card per label (see [`image-occlusion.md`](image-occlusion.md)).
4. Import an Anki package with images, and make cards from a video. Nothing the
   AI drafts joins a deck until it is accepted.

## 4. Practice and generated papers

1. `/dashboard/practice` shows recent notebooks under Continue working and
   folders under Study spaces.
2. A folder's tabs are Notebooks, Practice (when Past Paper Practice is on),
   Decks and Sources. Adding an existing deck or source to a folder, and
   removing it, never deletes the deck or source.
3. Generate a paper from `/dashboard/practice/new`. It is typeset in the
   board's house style, its graphs are drawn rather than pictured, and its
   print view (`/dashboard/practice/papers/<id>/print`) prints cleanly.
4. Answer the paper by hand and have it marked. Leave the page while it marks
   and come back: the mark arrives anyway.

## 5. Past Paper Practice

Behind `enablePastPaperPractice`, and behind a board switch on top of that. Skip
this section entirely when both are off — a not-found page is the correct
behaviour, and is itself worth confirming once.

Two AI steps here are durable jobs rather than parts of the request that asks
for them, so most of what follows is about states that outlive a page. None of
it can be judged from a screenshot taken at the right moment.

### Setup and session

1. Open `/dashboard/practice/questions/new?folderId=...` for a folder with an exam course.
2. Confirm the per-difficulty counts read `n ready` or `n+ ready`, not a raw total.
3. On a course with a checked topic list, confirm `Narrow to topics` appears and selecting one changes the counts.
4. On a course without one, confirm the explicit "Topics aren't available for this course yet" line appears — **not** an absent control.
5. Narrow until a shortage is forced. Confirm the shortage card offers Jami-created questions, starting short, or changing the mix.
6. Start a session and confirm the question, its tariff and any figure render.

### Answering

7. Type an answer, change question, come back: confirm the draft survived.
8. Type an answer and reload the page mid-sentence: confirm the last words are not lost.
9. Open the working sheet, draw, and confirm the pen, highlighter, eraser, undo, redo and colours behave as the notebook's do.
10. Confirm the sheet honours your saved pen-feel preference rather than a hardcoded one.
11. Submit and confirm the answer and sheet both freeze.

### Marking, which does not happen in the request

12. Confirm the page says the answer is being marked and that it carries on if you leave.
13. **Leave the page entirely, come back, and confirm the mark arrives anyway.** This cannot be seen any other way.
14. Confirm the mark report leads with the mark, then what earned it, then what to add next time.
15. Force a failure (kill the provider key) and confirm the failure card explains *which* failure, and only offers a retry for one that retrying could fix.
16. Confirm an over-long answer reopens for editing rather than freezing with a dead retry button.

### Checking a mark, which also does not

17. From a marked answer, press `Check this mark`.
18. Reload while it runs: confirm it still says a check is in progress and the button is not offered again.
19. Confirm a completed check shows the before and after marks when they differ, and says the mark stood when they do not.
20. Force a failing check and confirm it says the mark stands, says the check has not been used up, and offers `Try checking again`.
21. Confirm a second check is refused once one has completed.

### Retry, history and export

22. Take the guided second attempt and confirm the first mark stays readable beside it.
23. Finish the session and confirm the summary scores what was marked, not the whole paper.
24. Open `/dashboard/practice/history` and confirm the session reads correctly.
25. Export a marked question to a notebook and confirm the working image is not squashed — it is portrait, and should stay portrait.

### Owner surfaces

26. In `/dashboard/internal/exam-corpus`, ingest a paper as a dry run and confirm it reports what it extracted without storing anything.
27. Work the review queue and confirm question and paired scheme sit side by side.
28. Draw a spot-check sample and confirm it differs between draws.
29. Record a spot-check with nothing rejected and confirm the paper's questions become servable.
30. Record one rejecting everything drawn and confirm nothing becomes servable and the attempt is still recorded.

## 6. Tutor and sources

1. Add a source in `/dashboard/library` (a PDF, a pasted note, a link). Saving
   it creates no drafts, cards or questions on its own.
2. Ask Tutor (`/dashboard/tutor`, or the drawer in a notebook) about something
   in a folder with many sources. The answer draws on the right source by
   content, not by file name.
3. Ask Tutor to make flashcards from the conversation. They arrive as drafts to
   accept or discard.
4. In Personalise Jami (`/dashboard/tutor/personalise`), open the memory map.
   Correct a note, delete one, then turn memory off and confirm Tutor stops
   using it.
5. Make a revision plan from Tutor, and confirm Today then leads with the week
   and the next task.

## 7. Today, the Learning Engine and Revision Sessions

1. Without a revision plan, Today shows one next step, with "Why this?" folded
   away. The step's link opens the right page.
2. A topic with little evidence is never called weak, and untested topics are
   never shown as weak.
3. Start a Revision Session from a folder's Notebooks tab or from
   `/dashboard/revision/start?folder=...`. It opens full screen with no chat UI,
   teaches, asks a guided question, gives one retry when wrong, and then asks
   questions on your own.
4. Leave mid-session and come back within four hours: it resumes at the same
   step.
5. At the end, choose **Do later** on a next step and find it on the Tutor
   shelf.

See [`learning-engine-verification.md`](learning-engine-verification.md) for the
owner's production checks against real infrastructure.

## 8. Notifications

1. Turn notifications on in Account and allow them in the browser.
2. The daily nudge arrives after 4pm local time, and the evening reminder after
   7pm while Daily Review still has cards waiting. Nothing arrives after 10pm.
3. Turn the evening reminder off and confirm it stops the next day.
4. Change the device's time zone, open the dashboard, and confirm the next nudge
   follows the new zone. See [`notifications.md`](notifications.md).

## 9. Themes and long content

1. Switch themes and app backgrounds in `/dashboard/profile/personalise`. Text stays readable on
   every surface, including dialogs and the notebook toolbar.
2. On a phone, open a card, a Tutor reply and a mark report each containing a
   long equation. Only the equation scrolls.

## 10. Boundaries

These must never appear:

- the retired per-student question bank, its standalone Add question form, or
  mandatory per-question confidence blocks;
- any suggestion that Jami watches the screen, reads handwriting on its own, or
  processes uploads in the background;
- licensed exam questions whose permission record is missing, revoked or for a
  superseded specification.

## Reporting back

For each failure, give the section and step, the width or device, what you
expected, what happened, and any console error. A screenshot or recording helps
for anything visual.
