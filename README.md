Jami is a Next.js application backed by Firebase. Students keep each subject in a
folder with its notebooks, papers, flashcard decks and sources. They practise on
real past-paper questions or on papers Jami writes in the board's format, write
their answers by hand or type them, and have them marked by two independent AI
markers. What they get right and wrong feeds a learning model that picks the next
step: review cards, practise a topic, or sit a Revision Session where Jami teaches
the idea. Installed as a PWA, Jami caches the app shell and queues reviews taken
offline, replaying them when the connection returns.

## Product areas

The sidebar has ten destinations in two groups.

**Study**

| Destination | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Today | `/dashboard` | With a revision plan: the week, the next task, the rest of today and the exam countdown. Without one: one next step from the learning model |
| Learn | `/dashboard/study` | Scheduled and focused flashcard review |
| Practice | `/dashboard/practice` | Folders, notebooks, past-paper questions and generated papers |
| Jami | `/dashboard/tutor` | The tutor: ask about your sources, make a revision plan, review drafts |

**Workspace**

| Destination | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flashcards | `/dashboard/decks` | Decks, with every card at `/dashboard/cards` |
| Topics | `/dashboard/topics` | Concepts and subtopics linking material across folders |
| Goals | `/dashboard/goals` | Time, card, accuracy and streak targets for a chosen scope |
| Stars | `/dashboard/constellation` | Earned constellation rewards |
| Progress | `/dashboard/progress` | Weak topics, recent activity and review history |
| Account | `/dashboard/profile` | Profile, authentication and account deletion |

Other surfaces sit under those entries rather than having their own:

| Surface | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Notebook | `/dashboard/notebooks/[notebookId]` |
| Sources (the library the tutor reads) | `/dashboard/library` |
| Past-paper question session | `/dashboard/practice/questions/[sessionId]` |
| Generated paper | `/dashboard/practice/papers/[notebookId]` |
| Practice history | `/dashboard/practice/history` |
| Revision Session | `/dashboard/revision/[sessionId]` |
| Revision plan and tutor personalisation | `/dashboard/tutor/plan`, `/dashboard/tutor/personalise` |
| Owner workspace: paper quality and exam corpus | `/dashboard/internal/paper-quality`, `/dashboard/internal/exam-corpus` |

These old routes redirect indefinitely, so existing links keep working:
`/dashboard/practise` → `/dashboard/practice`, `/dashboard/learn` →
`/dashboard/study`, `/dashboard/stats` → `/dashboard/progress`.

## How it works

### Notebooks and flashcards

Notebooks are fixed-page and humble by design: typed notes, pen and highlighter
ink (`js-draw`, tuned for Apple Pencil), PDF pages rendered client-side with ink
overlays, and the original file never modified. Flashcards are scheduled with
FSRS (`ts-fsrs`) plus Jami's own prioritisation. Decks can be imported from Anki
packages, and drafted from notebooks, sources or a video. Nothing the AI drafts
joins a student's studying until they accept it.

### Past Paper Practice

Real exam questions from a shared, owner-curated corpus, currently about 2,900
questions from AQA and Pearson Edexcel GCSE papers. It is fail-closed: a question,
its mark scheme and its figures are served only while a versioned permission
record covers storage, display to students and AI inference
([`docs/past-paper-practice-rights.md`](docs/past-paper-practice-rights.md)).
Unverified, revoked or superseded-specification material may be stored for review
but is never shown. A student answers one question at a time, writing on the
question's printed pages or typing. They then get a mark, per-criterion feedback,
a next step and, once earned, the official scheme.

### Generated papers

Jami writes full practice papers in a board's own format. The exam-format
library ([`docs/exam-format-library.md`](docs/exam-format-library.md)) records each
component's duration, marks, sections, tariffs and command words from official
documents. Papers are typeset in the board's house style, and graphs are stated
as data and drawn by code rather than by the model. Generation and marking run
as durable Vercel Workflow jobs.

### Marking

Every answer is marked twice, blind: by a primary marker and a cheaper verifier,
in parallel. If they disagree, an adjudicator settles it. Point-marked disputes
go to the stronger model, and levels-marked disputes go to the worker, which was
measured as less harsh on essays. Essay disputes within one mark take the
worker's report without adjudication. Levels-marked questions carry the boards'
levels-of-response guidance. Every stage is checkpointed, so a retry pays only
for the stage that failed. A student can ask for an independent second look at
any marked answer.

The marker is also told how the board's examiners treat each kind of question.
These rules are read from the boards' own mark schemes and examiner reports:
112 subjects and 917 kinds of question across AQA, OCR and Pearson Edexcel GCSE
and AQA A-level. They are paraphrased, never copied, and every rule names its
sources.

### The Learning Engine and Revision Sessions

Jami keeps a model of what each student knows, one profile per folder (or per
deck, for cards that sit in no single folder). Mastery,
confidence and exposure are calculated deterministically in `lib/learning/`, and
no model is ever asked to estimate them. Weak areas need enough evidence before
Jami calls them weak, and untested is never treated as weak. Today, the tutor and
recommendations read that model; they do not own it. Learning evidence is
minimal and append-only: ids, scores and timestamps, never answer text.

When the model decides a student needs teaching, a Revision Session teaches it:
a short explanation with a worked example, a guided question with one retry, then
questions on their own ([`docs/revision-sessions.md`](docs/revision-sessions.md)).
The session's order is a deterministic state machine; the model only writes the
lesson and marks answers.

### AI

Students never choose models. A server-side router resolves logical roles to
approved models:

| Role | Used for | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker | Routine tutoring, the verifier marker, levels adjudication | GLM 5.3 Flash |
| Supervisor | Paper generation, the primary marker, point adjudication | Qwen3.6 35B A3B, with Kimi K3 as standby |
| Juror | An independent third view | Kimi K2.6 |
| Gemini | Grounded research, document vision, images, embeddings | Gemini Flash family |

Worker, supervisor and juror run through OpenRouter. The defaults are in
[`lib/ai/provider-policy.ts`](lib/ai/provider-policy.ts), and a deployment can
override them.

These constraints are enforced in code:

- **Provider privacy fails closed.** Every OpenRouter call requires zero data
  retention, denies data collection and uses explicit model and provider
  allowlists. A missing approved endpoint is an error, not permission to fall
  back ([`docs/ai-provider-release-gates.md`](docs/ai-provider-release-gates.md)).
- **Untrusted content is fenced.** Source text and student-written names sit
  inside per-request random boundary markers, so they cannot be read as
  instructions.
- **Context is relevant and bounded.** With source context on, the assistant
  ranks passages from up to fifteen sources in the current folder. The current
  page remains authoritative, and sources are read on demand.
- **Per-user budgets.** Request limits are counted in Firestore transactions, and
  refunded when a request fails before producing anything.
- **Deadlines everywhere.** Requests carry deadlines and are cancelled when the
  client disconnects. High-stakes stages retry durably without silently
  downgrading quality.

## Benchmarks

The measured numbers so far. None of them is a release approval: samples are
small, most cover one subject, and each links to the document with its method
and caveats.

### Marking accuracy on real exam scripts

Qualifications Scotland Higher Mathematics 2023, 67 real scripts, marked through
the student path against the examiner's mark-by-mark commentary (22 September
2026, [details](docs/past-paper-marking-release.md)):

| | August | September |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individual marks agreeing with the examiner | 79.7% | 82.5% |
| Total mark exactly right | 47.5% | 64.2% |
| Total mark within one | 88.5% | 92.5% |
| Bias per answer | +0.51 | +0.09 |
| Marks the examiner withheld that Jami awarded | 50% | 27% |

A larger supervisor (Kimi K2.6) changed one mark of 57 and made it worse, at
three to four times the cost. The model's size is not what limits this.

### Essay marking against two examiners

GCSE English Language reading answers (8 to 20 marks), each marked by two
examiners who differ from each other by 1.31 marks on average. The same 36
answers are marked each time (23 September 2026):

| | Before | Levels guidance | + worker adjudicates | + examiner practice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Distance from the examiners' mean | 2.26 | 1.88 | 1.15 | 1.10 |
| Within one mark of an examiner | 53% | 67% | 83% | — |
| Between the two examiners' marks | 28% | 31% | 53% | 61% |
| Bias per answer | −2.13 | −1.68 | −0.93 | — |

On 36 fresh answers no change was tuned on, the shipped marker sat 1.11 marks
from the examiners' mean, closer than the examiners were to each other (1.61).
Settling close essay disputes without adjudication cut adjudications from 30 to
18, with no measurable accuracy cost.

### Handwritten extended answers

Thirteen handwritten, examiner-marked Qualifications Scotland scripts. In Higher
Chemistry open questions (11 answers), the bias was +0.45 and 7 answers got
exactly the examiner's mark. In Higher History essays (2 answers), the bias was
+2.0. On real examiners' marks Jami leans slightly generous. One pattern persists:
answers an examiner calls "limited" are marked "reasonable".

### Feedback quality with researched question-type rules

Six AQA GCSE English Language answers were each marked twice, with the researched
rules and with the older hand-written guidance. A model from a different family
compared the two sets of feedback without knowing which was which (24 September
2026, `scripts/eval/feedback-comparison.ts`):

| | With researched rules | Hand-written guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preferred by the judge | 5 of 6 | 1 of 6 |
| Specific (1–5) | 4.33 | 3.83 |
| Actionable (1–5) | 4.33 | 3.33 |
| Accurate (1–5) | 4.50 | 3.17 |

With the rules, the mark was closer to the examiners' on 3 answers and the same
on 3. This is a small sample in the subject where the old guidance was already
strongest.

### Question-type coverage

Rules for 112 subjects: AQA GCSE (28 of 28), OCR GCSE (31 of 31), AQA A-level
(31 of 31) and Pearson Edexcel GCSE (22 of 25; its 2024 language specifications
have no public mark schemes yet). Across the corpus, between 76% (AQA Biology)
and 100% of questions per subject find a rule. Where a rule is found, it agrees
with the official scheme on whether the question is marked by levels or by points
for all but 16 of about 2,400 questions. Most questions without a rule are 1-mark
science items that fit several 1-mark kinds, and those are marked from their own
scheme.

### Paper generation

The owner benchmark freezes twelve components and generates 108 cases, each
reviewed against hard blockers: unanswerable questions, wrong schemes, invalid
totals, answer leakage and broken visuals. It has not passed yet. The first pilot
produced 0 of 12 usable papers, almost all harness and parser strictness. After
those fixes, a rerun of the six affected cases produced 3. See
[`docs/exam-format-library.md`](docs/exam-format-library.md).

### Tests

451 Vitest files (about 4,750 tests), plus Firestore and Storage rules tests and
a signed-in Playwright suite against the Firebase emulators.

Routes stay thin. Firebase and HTTP access belongs in `services`, pure domain
logic in `lib`, and reusable visual primitives in `components/ui`. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for dependency and compatibility
boundaries, and [`docs/ui-design-system.md`](docs/ui-design-system.md), which all
UI work must follow.

## Local development

### Requirements

- Node.js 22.13 or newer, and npm
- A Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore and Storage
- Java 21, to run the Firebase emulators for rules and browser tests
- OpenRouter and paid-tier Gemini API keys, only to exercise AI features

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jarems421/jami-flashcards.git
cd jami-flashcards
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in your own values
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The dashboard requires a signed-in Firebase user.

[`.env.example`](.env.example) lists every variable with safe placeholders:
- the Firebase client config and Admin credentials;
- Web Push keys and the cron secret;
- the AI provider keys with their privacy, quality and kill-switch gates, and the
  role models and provider allowlists;
- Practice switches: the exam-format library, per-board question switches, and
  paper and marking job limits;
- Sentry;
- four demo-mode variables that nothing in the codebase reads.

AI traffic stays off until its gates are set. Never commit `.env.local` or
production secrets.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict TypeScript checks, including unused code |
| `npm run lint` | Lint the repository |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite once |
| `npm run test:rules` | Firestore and Storage rules tests, in emulators |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Signed-in Playwright suite, in emulators |
| `npm run build` | Production build (runs the marking benchmark check first) |
| `npm run check` | Typecheck, lint, size limits, benchmark checks and Vitest |
| `npm run verify:all` | `check`, plus build, rules tests and browser tests |
| `npm run check:ai-release` | Live check that every approved AI endpoint is up and compliant |
| `npm run check:marking-release` | Strict marking release gate |
| `npm run check:marking-live` | How often markers disagreed on real students' attempts |
| `npm run report:ai-spend` | AI spend by user and action |
| `npm run firebase:rules:deploy` | Deploy Firestore rules, indexes and Storage rules |

Evaluation and research scripts run with
`node --env-file-if-exists=.env.local scripts/run-ts.mjs <script>`:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/eval/criterion-run.ts` | Mark a corpus through the student path and compare with examiners; `--variant` switches individual marker changes off |
| `scripts/eval/feedback-comparison.ts` | Blind comparison of feedback with and without researched rules |
| `scripts/eval/research-question-types.ts` | Research a board's question types; `--documents`, `--report` and `--matching` are free |
| `scripts/eval/paper-auto-review.ts` | AI review of a paper-benchmark run |

## Verification

Run focused tests while iterating, and the full gate before a release:

```bash
npm run verify:all
```

Pushes to `main` and pull requests run three parallel jobs in GitHub Actions
([`.github/workflows/quality.yml`](.github/workflows/quality.yml)):
- typecheck, lint, size limits, Vitest and a production build;
- Firestore and Storage rules tests;
- signed-in browser smoke tests on Chromium.

Green unit tests are not enough for UI work. Notebook and responsive changes
also need manual desktop, iPad and phone checks; see
[`docs/manual-qa.md`](docs/manual-qa.md). Pen feel can only be judged with a real
stylus. Before any marking evaluation or release, run `npm run check:ai-release`,
because approved AI endpoints drift within hours. Also make sure a deployment's
model variables match its provider lists
([`docs/past-paper-marking-release.md`](docs/past-paper-marking-release.md)).

## Security and data changes

Do not delete legacy Firestore structures, rules, indexes, compatibility fields,
or externally callable API routes on the strength of static import analysis alone.
Inventory production data and traffic first, then use an explicit migration or a
deprecation window. Licensed exam content never enters learner data, and learner
data never stores answer text, source content or tutor conversations.
