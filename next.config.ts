 * The restrictive policy, reported but not enforced.

 * No external origin is hardcoded anywhere in the app -- the Firebase SDK
 * builds its endpoints at runtime from config -- so `connect-src` cannot be
 * verified by reading the source. Enforcing a guess would break Firestore,
 * Auth or Storage in production while every local gate stayed green.
 *
 * Report-Only surfaces violations in the browser console at no runtime cost
 * and with no risk to a working app. Promote to enforcement once a real
 * session reports clean.
 *
 * `script-src` keeps 'unsafe-inline' deliberately. The strong alternative is a
 * per-request nonce, which requires middleware and forces every page to render
 * dynamically -- this app prerenders most of its routes, so that trade costs
 * real serverless invocations to harden a surface that `trust: false` KaTeX and
 * the enforced directives above already cover.
