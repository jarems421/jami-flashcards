/**
 * What the model actually does when asked to mark a page.
 *
 * Everything downstream of the model is deterministic and tested. This is the
 * one thing that is not, and unit tests cannot answer it: they prove that a
 * malformed verdict is refused, not how often one arrives.
 *
 * The harness deliberately reproduces the route's own contract -- the same
 * schema builder, the same instruction, the same parser, the same validator --
 * rather than approximating it, because a benchmark of a different contract
 * would measure nothing. What it leaves out is Firestore and auth: no evidence
 * is written and no student's data is read. The pages below are invented.
 *
 * This is the first run's job:
 *
 *   offered=false           the model declined to mark. For an unclear page
 *                           that is success, not failure.
 *   offered, accepted       a verdict that survived the contract.
 *   offered, rejected       an attempt that did not, with the reason.
 *
 * And one thing no counter can answer, so the accepted sample is printed in
 * full: do the criteria actually correspond to what the answer said?
