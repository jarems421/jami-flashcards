 * Records what became of one piece of the engine's advice.

 * gets to open a study session. Every caller fires it without waiting and
 * swallows the result -- losing the record that advice was shown is a smaller
 * harm by far than a link that hesitates.
 *
 * The id is deterministic per action, outcome and study day, and the rules
 * forbid updates, so a second write of the same thing is refused rather than
 * duplicated. That is what keeps `shown` from turning into a page-view counter
 * as the student comes back to Today through the day.
