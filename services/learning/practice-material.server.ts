/**
 * Storing questions Jami wrote, once the student has agreed to them.
 *
 * On the server, and it has to be. A practice paper is not an ordinary
 * document the owner may write: the rules let a browser create only an
 * *uploaded* paper with no questions and no marks, because "no assessment
 * definition, answer-bearing guide, result or timing transition" may originate
 * there. A first attempt at this wrote the paper straight from the browser and
 * would have been refused for every student, on four counts at once.
 *
 * The answer-bearing half is split off for the same reason. `pastPapers` is
 * the public projection -- readable by the student, and readable *only* while
 * its mark scheme carries no items -- so the real scheme lives in
 * `practicePaperSecrets`, which no client can read at all. Writing the paper
 * without that split does not fail loudly: `buildPracticePaperPayload` strips
 * the scheme on its way out, so the questions would simply arrive unmarkable.
 *
 * This is the same shape the ordinary paper-generation workflow writes, on
 * purpose. A question from a recommendation is then sat, marked and turned
 * into evidence by exactly the same code as any other.
