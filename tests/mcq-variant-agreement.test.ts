/**
 * The validator that stores a multiple-choice variant and the builder that
 * shows it have to agree.
 *
 * They did not, and a Multiple Choice session lost most of its queue to it. The
 * prompt asks the model to write the correct option in the distractors' shape --
 * "same length, same opening" -- so on a card with a long answer it comes back
 * shortened, deliberately. The validator checked that shortened option against
 * the distractors and stored it. The builder then tested it with
 * `equivalentOption`, which is an answer-marking check and does not recognise a
 * summary, threw it away, put the card's raw answer back in its place, and
 * refused the question a line later because the long answer stood out against
 * three short wrong ones. The card was admitted to the session and could never
 * be asked.
 *
 * So: a variant the validator accepts must be one the builder can build.
