/**
 * Four surfaces, one learner, and evidence that disagrees.
 *
 * This is the end of the road P0 and P1 were built for. A student drills
 * "Quadratics" on flashcards and gets them right; sits generated practice on
 * completing the square and does middlingly; sits real exam questions on the
 * same concept and does badly; and has a notebook page on it marked poorly.
 *
 * Every one of those four streams used to land somewhere different -- two
 * unrelated concept namespaces, one with no concept at all, and one that was
 * not recorded. Now they meet, and the thing that must NOT happen is that they
 * average into a single number. "72% at quadratics" would be a worse answer
 * than any of the four pieces of evidence taken alone.
 *
 * What must happen instead: the broad Topic reads as the student's recall
 * looks, the specific concept reads as their application looks, and the two
 * numbers stay apart with their sources attached, so Jami can say which is
 * which.
