/**
 * A star's `size` is stored on one of two scales and the number cannot say
 * which.
 *
 * Before the rarity presets it was a 0..1 fraction; since then it has been
 * ln(targetCards + 1). Those ranges overlap for small goals -- a one-card goal
 * gives ln(2) = 0.69 -- so a star read on the wrong scale is drawn at entirely
 * the wrong size, silently and with no error anywhere.
 *
 * That has now happened twice. The marker was `presetId`, a field for something
 * else whose absence happened to date a star, and deleting the rarity presets
 * stopped it being written: every new star was dated as ancient and the
 * onboarding star was drawn at 42px instead of 18px. These tests exist so the
 * third time is caught here rather than in the sky.
